# aiMate Logo Generation Prompts

Based on the aiMate project philosophy of providing free, safe, and sovereign AI for all Kiwis with a focus on privacy, workspace collaboration, and cultural awareness.

---

## Prompt 1: Kiwi Identity & Authenticity

**Style:** Modern, friendly, approachable
**Concept:** New Zealand-focused AI companion

```
A modern, minimalist logo featuring a stylized kiwi bird (New Zealand's national symbol) merged with abstract AI neural network nodes. The kiwi is formed by connected dots and lines suggesting both the bird's organic shape and digital connectivity. Color palette: Deep purple (#764ba2) and vibrant teal, with clean white space. The design should feel warm and approachable rather than corporate or cold. Include subtle fern frond patterns in the negative space. Style: flat design, geometric, friendly, tech-forward but grounded in nature.
```

## Prompt 2: Privacy & Data Sovereignty

**Style:** Secure, trustworthy, shield-like
**Concept:** Privacy-first workspace guardian

```
A logo combining a protective shield with an open hand, symbolizing both security and openness. Inside the shield, subtle binary code or data streams flow upward like smoke or mist, representing data that stays under user control. The shield has soft, rounded edges to feel approachable rather than militaristic. Color gradient from deep purple (#667eea) to violet (#764ba2). Include a small silver fern detail at the base. The overall feel should be "guardian" not "fortress" - protective but welcoming. Style: clean, modern, slightly abstract, professional yet warm.
```

## Prompt 3: Workspace & Collaboration Hub

**Style:** Connected, collaborative, organized
**Concept:** AI workspace platform for teams

```
An interconnected workspace visualization: multiple chat bubbles or workspace windows arranged in a circular or orbital pattern around a central AI core (represented as a glowing purple sphere or node). Thin lines connect the workspaces, suggesting collaboration and knowledge sharing. Each workspace bubble contains subtle icons: code brackets, document lines, lightbulb for ideas. The design should convey "organized creativity" and "connected thinking spaces." Purple gradient palette (#667eea to #764ba2) with white workspace bubbles. Style: isometric or 2.5D, clean lines, modern SaaS aesthetic, friendly and productive.
```

## Prompt 4: Open Source & Cultural Transparency

**Style:** Open, transparent, culturally aware
**Concept:** Community-driven AI for New Zealand

```
A logo featuring an open book or unfolding map with abstract AI circuitry patterns as the "text," symbolizing open-source transparency and knowledge sharing. Incorporate subtle Māori koru (spiral) patterns flowing from the pages, representing growth, harmony, and new life. The design should feel both technological and culturally respectful. Include a color palette inspired by New Zealand landscapes: purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) with touches of silver fern green and earth tones. The overall composition should be balanced and welcoming, suggesting "AI built by the community, for the community." Style: modern flat design with subtle cultural motifs, organic meets digital.

## General Design Guidelines

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Accent: Teal, silver fern green
- Background: White or very light purple

**Typography Suggestions (if including text):**
- Sans-serif, modern but friendly
- Lowercase "aiMate" or "ai mate" for approachability
- Avoid overly technical/corporate fonts

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Incorporate Māori design elements respectfully (koru, fern, traditional patterns)
- Avoid appropriation - keep cultural elements subtle and tasteful
- The design should feel distinctly "New Zealand" without being clichéd

**Overall Tone:**
- Friendly, not corporate
- Secure, not fortress-like
- Modern, not cold
- Accessible, not dumbed-down
- Professional workspace tool, not consumer chat toy

---

## Usage Notes

These prompts can be used with:
- DALL-E 3
- Midjourney
- Stable Diffusion
- Professional designers as creative briefs

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Generate variations using prompts 1-4
2. Combine elements from favorites
3. Refine with specific feedback
4. Test at different sizes (favicon, header, social media)
5. Ensure it works in monochrome for versatility

---

## Design Iterations

After initial generation, consider variations that:
- Work well at 16x16px (favicon)
- Scale to large format (website headers)
- Look good in monochrome/single color
- Are recognizable without text
- Reflect the specific personality mode (Kiwi Mate, Mental Health Guardian, etc.)

---

**Remember:** The logo should embody aiMate's core values:
- 🆓 Truly free and open source
- 🥝 Authentically Kiwi
- 🏢 Workspace-focused
- 🔒 Privacy-first
- 🌏 Culturally aware

It's not just another chat interface - it's a complete AI workspace platform built for New Zealanders, by New Zealanders.
