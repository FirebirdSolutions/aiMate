🤖 AI Users & Enthusiasts - We Need Your Input! 🚀

Hey everyone! I'm working on building a better AI assistant and would love to hear about YOUR experiences with AI tools.

📋 Quick 5-minute survey about:
- What AI tools you use (or don't use)
- What frustrates you about current options
- What features you wish existed
- Your ideal AI assistant

🎁 Plus, if you're interested, you can sign up for early alpha access to our platform!

🎯 Help Shape the Future of AI Tools! (5-minute survey)

Hi everyone! I'm building an AI assistant called aiMate and I need your help understanding what people actually want from AI.

Don't worry - you don't need to be a tech expert! In fact, we especially want to hear from people who:
- Have never used AI tools
- Tried them but got frustrated
- Use them every day
- Are curious but don't know where to start

The survey takes about 5 minutes and asks about:
✅ Your experience level with technology
✅ Whether you use AI tools (and which ones)
✅ What stops you from using them (if you don't)
✅ What your ideal AI assistant would do

💡 Bonus: Get early access to alpha testing if interested!

Appreciate your time! 🙌
